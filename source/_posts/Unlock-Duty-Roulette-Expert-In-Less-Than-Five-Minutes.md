#  How To Unlock Duty Roulette Expert - The Ultimate Guide

Duty Roulette is a great way to get some of the best rewards in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. There are several different Duty Roulette's available, but the Expert one offers the best rewards. However, it can be quite challenging to unlock. In this guide, I will show you how to unlock Duty Roulette Expert.

The first step is to complete the main scenario quest line up to "The Ultimate Weapon". Once you have completed this quest, you will receive a new quest called "The Scions of the Seventh Dawn". This quest is part of the Heavensward expansion and is required to unlock Duty Roulette Expert.

Once you have completed "The Scions of the Seventh Dawn" quest, you will need to speak with Gwyneth mapping in Idyllshire (X:6.7 Y:8.5). She will give you a quest called "A Vision of the Future". This quest requires you to complete three duties in each of the following categories: Dun Scaith, The Fractal Continuum and Neverreap.

Once you have completed all three duties in each category, return to Gwyneth mapping and she will give you another quest called "The Future of Eorzea". This quest requires you to complete three duties in each of the following categories: Hullbreaker Isle (Hard), The Weeping City of Mhach (Hard) and Alexander - Midas (Savage).

Once you have completed all three duties in each category, return to Gwyneth mapping and she will give you a final quest called "The Fate of Eorzea". This quest requires you to complete three duties in each of the following categories: The Tower of Loathing (Extreme), The Binding Coil of Bahamut (First Time) and Alexander - Gordias (Savage).

Once you have completed all three duties in each category, return to Gwyneth mapping and she will give you a final quest called "The Fate of Eorzea". This quest requires you to complete three duties in each of the following categories: The Tower of Loathing (Extreme), The Binding Coil of Bahamut (First Time) and Alexander - Gordias (Savage).

Speak with Gwyneth again and she will give you a key item called "Final Rest". This item allows entry into Duty Roulette Expert.

#  Make Sure You Unlock Duty Roulette Expert Before The Next Tier 8 Raid!

Duty Roulette Expert is a key part of progressing through the game content. It not only offers great rewards, but it’s also the only way to access some of the most challenging content in the game.

Fortunately, unlocking Duty Roulette Expert is easy. Simply complete any tier 8 dungeon and you will be given the option to start the Duty Roulette: Expert.

However, it’s important to make sure that you unlock it before attempting the next tier 8 raid. The reason for this is simple – if you don’t have Duty Roulette Expert unlocked, you won’t be able to queue for the raid!

This may seem like an odd restriction, but it’s actually there for your protection. The tier 8 raids are incredibly difficult, and can easily lead to wipes if your party isn’t prepared. By making sure that everyone has access to Duty Roulette Expert, you help ensure that everyone has a chance to join in on the action.

#  Unlock Duty Roulette Expert And Get Ahead Of The Competition!

Duty Roulette Expert is a new game mode in Final Fantasy XIV that can be unlocked by completing the main scenario. It features tougher battles and better rewards, which is why it’s such an attractive proposition for players looking to get ahead. In this guide, we’re going to show you how to unlock Duty Roulette Expert and make the most of its awesome benefits!

The first step is to complete the main scenario. This will automatically unlock Duty Roulette: Expert for you. Once you’ve done that, you need to head to Central Tyria and speak with the NPC called “Free Companies Director”. He can be found in The Battle of Kyhlo. This will activate the duty roulette for your account.

Now that you know how to unlock Duty Roulette Expert, let’s take a look at what benefits it has to offer! The first thing you’ll notice is that there are better rewards on offer. You’ll also find that the battles are much tougher, so it’s a great way to challenge yourself and improve your skills.

Another great benefit of Duty Roulette Expert is that it provides extra experience points and Gil. This can be a great way to help you progress through the game faster. You should also keep in mind that the duty roulette resets every week, so make sure you take advantage of it while you can!
