# What is the Blackjack in Blackjack? Insights from Hasek

Jaroslav Hasek was a Czech writer known for his satirical novel, "The Good Soldier Å vejk".

## Understanding the Basics of Blackjack

Before discussing the meaning of "blackjack" in blackjack, it is important to understand the basics of the game.

The objective of the game is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand value without going over 21.

## The Meaning of "Blackjack" in Blackjack

In blackjack, "blackjack" refers to a specific hand consisting of an ace and a ten-value card, such as a king, queen, jack, or ten. This hand is also known as a "natural 21" and is the strongest possible hand in the game.

According to Hasek, the term "blackjack" may have originated from the game's early origins in France. In the French game "Vingt-et-un", which is believed to be the precursor to blackjack, the ace had a value of one or eleven, while the face cards had a value of ten. A hand consisting of an ace and a face card was called a "black jack", which referred to the black suit of the cards.
