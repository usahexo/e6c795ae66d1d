#  What are Baby Bloomers?

Baby bloomers are a type of underpants for toddlers and young children. They are a lightweight, breathable underwear option that is perfect for summer weather. Baby bloomers typically have an elastic waistband and a gathered fabric crotch to provide a comfortable and secure fit.

Bloomers were first introduced in the early 1800s as a pantalette style undergarment for women. They were made of light, sheer fabrics and featured a leg-o-mutton sleeve design. In the early 1900s, bloomers began to be worn by both men and women as underwear. They were also popular as trendy play clothes for children. Bloomers remained popular until the 1930s when they were replaced by modern panties and briefs.

In recent years, baby bloomers have begun to experience a resurgence in popularity. This is largely due to the fact that they are an ideal choice for toddlers and young children who are starting to potty train. Baby bloomers are comfortable, easy to pull up and down, and provide a little extra coverage when accidents occur.

If you are looking for an attractive and comfortable undergarment for your child this summer, consider purchasing a set of baby bloomers. They are sure to keep your little one cool and comfortable all season long!
