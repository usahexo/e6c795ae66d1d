#  Valencia CF's Odds of Winning the League are Increasing by the Day!

Valencia CF is a Spanish football club based in Valencia. The club was founded in 1919 and currently plays in the La Liga. Los Che are one of the most successful clubs in Spanish football, having won six La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey trophies, two Inter-Cities Fairs Cups (which was the predecessor to the UEFA Cup), one European Cup Winners' Cup and one UEFA Champions League. They also reached two UEFA Cup finals, which they lost to two English teams: First Liverpool in 1978 and then Chelsea in 1980.

The 2017-2018 La Liga season has been full of surprises so far. Plenty of unexpected results and many teams battling for top spot. One of those teams is Valencia CF. They had a bit of a shaky start to the season but have since found their form and are now looking like serious contenders for the league title. Their odds of winning the league have been steadily increasing by the day and it's not hard to see why!

One of the biggest reasons for their success this season has been their incredible strike force. Led by Michy Batshuayi, Rodrigo Moreno and Gonçalo Guedes, this trio has been absolutely lethal in front of goal. Between them, they have scored an impressive 27 goals in just 18 matches! This deadly trio has been instrumental in Los Che's rise up the table and they will be looking to continue their good form as they push for that league title.

Another reason for their resurgence has been their solid defence. Led by captain Dani Parejo and young star Geoffrey Kondogbia, Valencia have conceded just 18 goals in 18 matches this season. This is a testament to their defensive stability and organisation which has been key to their success so far. With players like José Gayà, Jaume Domènech and Gabriel Paulista providing backup, Valencia have one of the strongest defences in La Liga right now.

All things considered, Valencia CF are looking like real contenders for the La Liga title this season! Their odds of winning are increasing by the day as they continue to impress with some impressive displays both offensively and defensively. If they can maintain this level of performance until the end of the season, there's no doubt that they will be crowned champions!
