According to club president and Bahçeşehir Koleji senior Sinan Özdemir, the idea for the club came about organically.

#  Bahçeşehir Koleji Poker Club - A Force to be Reckoned With

This weekend I had the pleasure of attending the Bahçeşehir Koleji Poker Club’s monthly tournament. The BKCPC is a relatively new club, but it is quickly gaining a reputation as one of the best clubs in Istanbul. The club has a great location in Bahçeşehir, a suburb of Istanbul, and the players are some of the best I have ever played against.

The tournament was a $10 buy-in No Limit Hold’em event with a $1,000 guaranteed prize pool. There were 97 entries, and the prize pool was over $1,100. The final table was full of very tough competition, and after several hours of play, Murat Yılmaz emerged victorious.

Murat is an extremely talented player who has been playing poker for over 10 years. He is also a successful businessman who owns several restaurants in Istanbul. I had the pleasure of playing heads-up against him for the title, and I can tell you that he is definitely not someone to be taken lightly.

The BKCPC is definitely a force to be reckoned with, and if you are ever in Istanbul, I highly recommend checking out their tournaments. The players are top-notch, and the atmosphere is second to none.
