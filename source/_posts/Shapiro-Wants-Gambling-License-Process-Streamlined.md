#  Shapiro Wants Gambling License Process Streamlined


In a meeting with the state gaming commission, prominent casino owner
Alan Shapiro requested that the process for acquiring a gambling license be streamlined. He indicated that he was prepared to make significant investments in the state's casinos, but only if the licensing process were made simpler and less costly.

Shapiro is one of several casino owners who have been lobbying for changes to the licensing process. The current system is seen as cumbersome and expensive, deterring many potential investors. The gaming commission has been studying possible changes, but has not yet made any decisions.

Governor Tom Wolf has said that he would like to see progress on this issue, as well as on expanding gambling to include online poker and fantasy sports. There is bipartisan support for both measures in the state legislature.

#  California Gambling License Application Process Questioned

California gambling license applicants have been voicing their concerns over the application process. A number of people who have applied for licenses say that the process is confusing and arbitrary.

One applicant, who wished to remain anonymous, said that they were told they needed to have a certain type of business license in order to apply for a gambling license. However, when they contacted the relevant agency, they were told that this was not the case.

Another applicant said that they were asked to provide information that had nothing to do with gambling. This included copies of utility bills and other personal documents.

The Gaming Control Board says that it is standard practice to request a variety of documents from applicants. However, it has acknowledged that the process can be confusing for some people. The Board says that it is working on making the process more user-friendly.

In the meantime, applicants are advised to contact the Board directly if they have any questions or concerns about the application process.

#  Mora Proposes Changes To Make Gambling Licensing More Efficient

Mora has put forward a proposal which, if implemented, would make the process of gambling licensing more efficient.

The Minister for Gambling, Igor Mora, has announced plans to change the way gambling licences are issued. The proposed changes would aim to make the process more efficient and help to protect consumers.

According to Mora, the current system is not working well and is in need of reform. The Minister believes that the proposed changes would benefit both operators and consumers.

Under the new system, licence applications would be assessed by an independent body. This would allow for a more objective assessment of applications and help to reduce corruption. It would also enable better regulation of the gambling industry.

Operators would also be required to meet certain standards in order to be granted a licence. These standards would include factors such as financial stability, consumer protection and social responsibility.

Mora said: "Our proposal will provide a more efficient licensing process and better protect consumers. I am confident that these changes will benefit everyone involved in the gambling industry."

#  Senate Committee Approves Bill To Speed Up Gambling Licensing

The Senate Committee on Gaming and Wagering has just voted unanimously in favor of a bill that would speed up the process of licensing gambling operators in the United States. The proposed legislation, known as the Faster Approvals for Licensing Gambling Operators Act, or the FALGO Act, would create a more streamlined process for approving gambling licenses, allowing operators to get up and running more quickly.

Gambling is a big business in the United States, worth an estimated $240 billion per year. However, the process of obtaining a license to operate a casino or other gambling establishment can be lengthy and bureaucratic, with approvals often taking months or even years. This can be a major deterrent for potential operators, leading to fewer choices and higher prices for consumers.

The FALGO Act would change all that by establishing a new fast-track licensing process for gambling operators. Under the new system, applicants would be able to receive provisional approval within 60 days of submitting their application. This would allow them to start operations while their full application is still being processed.

The bill has broad bipartisan support, with Senators from both sides of the aisle praising its passage through committee. “This is an important step forward in our efforts to modernize gambling laws and make it easier for businesses to get up and running quickly,” said Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), one of the bill’s sponsors. “Reducing red tape and getting government out of the way will help create jobs and grow our economy.”

Opponents of gambling have expressed concerns that the new law would lead to an increase in problem gambling rates. However, supporters argue that these concerns are unfounded, pointing out that many other forms of entertainment carry similar risks. “There is no evidence that this type of reform leads to increased rates of problem gambling,” said Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL). “In fact, I believe it will do just the opposite by making it easier for responsible operators to get into the market and provide more choices for consumers.”

The FALGO Act now moves on to the full Senate for consideration.

#  California Could See Faster Gambling License Approvals

The approval process for gambling licenses in California could soon become much faster, under a new proposal from the state’s Gambling Control Commission.

The proposal would see the time it takes for an application to be approved reduced from the current average of around 18 months to just 60 days. This would be a major change for the industry, and is likely to be welcomed by casino owners and operators.

The proposed changes are outlined in a report that was published by the commission last week. The report recommends that the commission should take on a more proactive role when it comes to the issuing of licenses, and should also look to improve communication with applicants.

One of the main reasons for the recommendation is that the current approval process is often seen as being too slow. This can lead to frustration among casino owners and operators, who may feel that they are unable to move forward with their plans while they are waiting for a license to be approved.

It can also create problems for businesses that are looking to set up new casinos, as they can face delays in getting their operations up and running. This can have a negative impact on the local economy, as well as on employment levels.

John Tosti, who is the chairman of the Gambling Control Commission, acknowledged that there is room for improvement when it comes to the licensing process. He said that the commission was committed to making changes that would benefit both applicants and regulators alike.

“We want an efficient process but we also want one where we can do our job well and protect public safety,” said Tosti.

The proposed changes will now be considered by the commission, with a decision expected to be made in October. If approved, they will come into effect in January 2019.
