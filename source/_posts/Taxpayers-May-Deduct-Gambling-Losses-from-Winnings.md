#  Taxpayers May Deduct Gambling Losses from Winnings

Taxpayers can often deduct their gambling losses from their gambling winnings when filing their taxes. In order to do this, taxpayers must keep track of their winnings and losses separately. This deduction is only available to taxpayers who itemize their deductions on their tax returns.

Some taxpayers may not be able to take the full deduction for their losses. If a taxpayer's losses exceed their winnings, they can only deduct the amount of their losses that exceed the amount of their winnings. This means that if a taxpayer had $1,000 in winnings and $2,000 in losses, they could only deduct $1,000 in losses.

There are some restrictions on who can claim a gambling loss deduction. The taxpayer must have actually incurred the losses themselves. They cannot deduct losses that were incurred by someone else. In addition, the taxpayer cannot deduct any wagers that were placed on horses or dogs.

The gambling loss deduction is a valuable way for taxpayers to reduce their taxable income. It can help them save money on their taxes and get a little bit of relief from the expenses associated with gambling.

#  IRS Limits Gambling Tax Deductions for high-rollers

The IRS is cracking down on gambling tax deductions for high-rollers.

Individuals who gamble and claim losses totaling more than $1500 in a year will now be required to provide documentation that proves their losses were not offset by winnings.

Previously, taxpayers were only required to report gambling winnings on their tax returns, but no information was solicited regarding losses. This made it easy for high-rollers to write off their losses as a tax deduction.

The new rules, which went into effect this year, are an effort by the IRS to close this tax loophole. They are also meant to help ensure that taxes are paid on all gambling income, including winnings and losses.

The new rules apply not only to casino gamblers, but also to those who gamble online or play the lottery. Gambling income includes not just cash winnings, but also the fair market value of any prizes or awards won.

Taxpayers who are subject to the new rules will need to file Form 8300, Report of Cash Payments Over $10,000 Received in a Trade or Business. This form must be filed whenever taxpayers receive more than $10,000 in cash from any one person in a single transaction or two or more related transactions within a 12-month period.

Failure to file Form 8300 can result in significant penalties, including fines and imprisonment.

#  You May Claim Gambling Losses on Your Tax Return

The Internal Revenue Service allows taxpayers to deduct their gambling losses on their tax return. This includes losses from casino gambling, dog racing, horseracing, and state lottery games.

To claim your gambling losses on your tax return, you will need to itemize your deductions. Gambling losses are listed as a miscellaneous deduction and are subject to a 2% of your adjusted gross income (AGI) limit. This means that you can only deduct the amount of your gambling losses that is greater than 2% of your AGI.

For example, if you have an AGI of $50,000, you can only deduct the amount of your gambling losses that is greater than $1,000 (2% of $50,000). If you have $5,000 in gambling losses, you can only deduct $4,000 ($5,000 - $1,000).

Keep in mind that you cannot use your gambling winnings to offset your gambling losses. Gambling winnings are taxable income and must be reported on your tax return.

#  Tax Breaks for Gambling Winnings, Losses Vary Widely by State

Gamblers face a maze of tax rules when they hit the jackpot or lose their shirt.

Forty-five states and the District of Columbia levy taxes on gambling winnings, but the rates and what is taxed vary greatly, according to a report from the Tax Foundation.

Gambling income includes money or property won at casinos, racetracks, lottery tickets, off-track betting, and card games such as blackjack and poker.

Income from bingo and other charitable gaming is generally taxable unless the winner is entitled to receive all prizes in the form of merchandise or services. Gambling losses can also be deducted from winnings when filing taxes.

Most states exempt some or all of a gambler's first $1,200 worth of winnings from taxation. The median state exemption is $5,000, while nine states (Alaska, California, Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas) do not tax gambling winnings at all.

On the other end of the spectrum, Indiana taxes gambling winnings over $5,000 at a rate of 3.4%. Other states with high tax rates include Missouri (7%), Iowa (8%), and Tennessee (9.5%).

Thirty-eight states allow gamblers to deduct their losses up to certain amount; the median state limit is $600. Alabama allows gamblers to deduct losses only if they itemize their deductions; Connecticut and Maine do not allow any deduction for gambling losses.

#  Can I Claim a Gambling Loss on My Taxes?

When it comes to gambling, there are many misconceptions about what is and is not tax deductible. For example, many taxpayers believe they can deduct their losses from their taxable income. The truth is that you can only deduct your gambling losses if you itemize your deductions on your tax return.

In order to claim your gambling losses, you must keep track of all of your wagers and winnings. You must also have documentation to support your claims. This includes receipts, tickets, and other records of your bets. If you gamble online, you must keep track of the amount you wagered and the winnings or losses from each game.

The good news is that you can deduct any expenses related to your gambling activity, such as travel costs, food, and entertainment expenses. However, these deductions are limited to the amount of your winnings. So if you lose $1,000 but only win $500, you can only deduct $500 in expenses.

It's important to note that the IRS does not consider gambling a hobby or investment. Gambling is considered a "personal pleasure." As a result, any losses incurred from gambling are not deductible in any other way.

If you decide to itemize your deductions on your tax return, be sure to include your gambling losses on Schedule A under "other Miscellaneous Deductions." You will need to enter the total amount of your losses and then subtract it from the total amount of your winnings. If the net result is a loss, then that loss can be deducted from your taxable income.

Keep in mind that itemizing deductions usually makes sense only if they exceed the standard deduction for your filing status. So if the standard deduction for someone who files as single is $6,300 in 2018, then it may not be worth itemizing deductions unless the taxpayer has more than $6,300 in gambling losses for the year.
