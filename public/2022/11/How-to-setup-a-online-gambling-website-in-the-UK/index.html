If you’re considering setting up an online gambling platform of your own, there are a few key things you need to know. In this article, we’ll take you through the basics of how to set up a gambling website in the UK.</p>
<p>Firstly, it’s important to understand the regulatory landscape around gambling in the UK. In order to offer betting or casino services to British customers, you must be licenced by the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC). The good news is that the UKGC is one of the most liberal gambling regulators in the world, and there are a range of licencing options available depending on your business model.</p>
<p>Once you have obtained your licence from the UKGC, you will need to set up a website or app that meets their technical and security requirements. The website must be easy to use and navigate, and must meet all relevant legal and compliance requirements.</p>
<p>The final step is to market your platform to customers in the UK. This can be done through a variety of channels such as online advertising, PR campaigns, and social media marketing. It’s important to remember that in order to comply with UK law, your marketing materials must not mislead customers about the risks associated with gambling.</p>
<p>If you follow these steps, you should be able to set up a successful online gambling platform in the UK.</p>
