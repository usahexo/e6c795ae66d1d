It’s also important to have healthy activities and hobbies that help you relax and de-stress.</p>
<p>You also need to be honest with your parent about how you’re feeling and what’s going on in your life. Don’t hide anything from them out of fear of upsetting them or triggering a relapse. sharing your feelings honestly is one of the best ways to build trust and open up communication lines between you and your parent.</p>
<p>If your parent is ready, encourage them seek treatment for their addiction. Treatment centers offer counseling and therapy sessions as well as medication-assisted treatment plans if needed.
